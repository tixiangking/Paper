This paper studied the clock synchronization in the integration of IEEE 802.1 TSN and 5G mobile technology in industrial communication networks.  To address this issue, the manuscript proposes a clock synchronization scheme with timestamp compensation and carrier spacing optimization for synchronization accuracy. The proposed network architecture suggests a heterogeneous network convergence scheme for 5G+TSN in this particular scenario.  This is a solid conference paper and hence I recommend to accept it.
